    <p>This page is a collection of information for our house search, from
       the criteria that we use to find a house, the materials we use to learn 
       about the process, to the actual candidates that we have considered. 
       We want to document the whole process so that future new home owners have
       a reference for their first home search. We hope you enjoy the information
       found here. Contact us to share your story or give us suggestion on what 
       we should look into!
